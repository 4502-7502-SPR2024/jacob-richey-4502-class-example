      <h1>Honeymoon: An artist’s book</h1>

      <p>I made this book in May 2023 out of handmade paper using techniques of pulp painting and pouring. It is a translation of stories from my music, using traditional bookbinding techniques and structure to draw a narrative from materials that may otherwise not seem storied. I use found plant materials, including flower petals and roots, to analogize the quick bloom of springtime flowers with loss and death.</p>

    <figcaption>The cover of the book, titled “Honeymoon,” interprets the cover of my music album by the same name. It is made with sprayed pulp paint, as well as hand-placed fibers to create the figure.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-01.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-02.jpg" alt="An open book with pink, orange, yellow, and white marbled paper with small flower scraps ranging from yellow to brown. Blue-green text appears once on each page, and tiny handwritten words appear around the edges. The two printed phrases are: 'Building empires on my ceiling, basking in the disbelief' and 'Please don't let our honeymoon hearts fade with the sunset.' The handwritten text says: 'Plant yourself in the break of dawn. Burn away the pain like the morning fog' and 'It's that feeling of all-knowing when you look at someone and some force to be reckoned with says you're about to fall in love.'">
    <figcaption>The book is made in three parts, with each part’s pages composed of different color patterns. Ground flower petals are included in each page, and they are soaked in soda ash — a dye fixative — to preserve color.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-02.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <img src="img/honeymoon-03.jpg" alt="A close-up of the bottom of an open book with marbled pink, orange, and white paper with tiny yellow and brown flower scraps in it. The small, handwritten text 'Burn away the pain like the morning fog' appears on the bottom of the page.">
    <figcaption>Handwritten text accompanies printed text that is ironed onto the flax pages using fabric transfers.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-03.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <img src="img/honeymoon-04.jpg" alt="An extreme close-up of the pink, white, and orange marbled paper that shows the detail of the yellow and brown flower scraps in the paper. The middle of the photo shows slight wrinkling on the paper that resembles the texture of rose petals.">
    <figcaption>Some pages have full petals embedded in them, in addition to the ground petal inclusions. Several rose petals are embedded in this page beneath swirled pink and yellow pulp.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-04.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-05.jpg" alt="An open book with marbled white, blue, and gray paper that goes from white on the left to gray on the right. There are a few small, dried brown flower petals sitting on top of the pages and handwritten text in three of the corners with the printed text, 'Just breathe,' in the middle of the spread. The handwritten text reads: 'It's a long drive home,' 'I gave you my best wishes,' and 'I know we're dancing in the kitchen, but I still want to cry. You critique my every move and tell me to act like a guy.'">
    <figcaption>The second third of the book has blue-gray toned paper with dried petals on the surface of the paper. The white pulp swirls to dark blue-gray in an abstract depiction of storm clouds rolling in.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-05.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-06.jpg" alt="An open book with light-blue paper with a bit of light green marbled at the bottom. There is a large, dried yellow rose on the left-hand page with a smaller dried purple flower to the left of it and handwritten and printed text. The handwritten text reads, 'I picked your petals, and I gave you my life,' and the printed text reads, 'And you cut me at the root to take me inside,' and 'I swore I'd always love you, and it looks like I meant it.'">
    <figcaption>The last third of the book is more experimental, with full flower inclusions and muddier pulps with dandelion root pulp blended with the flax.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-06.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-07.jpg" alt="A close-up of the corner of a page with lots of tiny flecks of brown dried petals and some longer yellow strands, making it appear rough. The handwritten words 'I'm sorry' appear three times on the page.">
    <figcaption>The book chronologically follows the tracks of the “Honeymoon” album, with the final third of the book drawing from the last four tracks of the record. Small handwritten lyrics hide in the busy pulp in the end of the book.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-07.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-08.jpg" alt="The last page of the book is pictured, made of lightly colored paper marbled with green, white, and blue. At the bottom-center appear the handwritten words: 'Now our honeymoon has long burned out, I watch the sunset through tear-stained vows. I like to believe it's you now, painting each one' with a tiny handwritten heart after the words.">
    <figcaption>The final line of the album is written on the final page of the book.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-08.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <img src="img/honeymoon-09.jpg" alt="A square piece of paper with a pink-to-yellow gradient has on it a scrap of paper with a handwritten infinity symbol with a blue-purple balloon above it. The square piece is mounted onto a neutral-colored background with dark yellow and brown scraps in it.">
    <figcaption>The back cover of the book has a scrap of paper attached using pulp paint. The pulp paintings on the front and back covers are pasted on top of the cover paper.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-09.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
    <img src="img/honeymoon-10.jpg" alt="A close-up of the stitching of the book. Three stitches are visible, and they each have a twisting appearance. There are two hard covers with three signatures between them — one that is orange, one that is blue, and one that is green.">
    <figcaption>The book has 24 pages and is coptic bound. It has hard covers that are covered with paper made from a blend of the pulps used throughout the book.&nbsp;<a href="img/honeymoon-10.jpg" target="_blank">View the full image.</a></figcaption>
